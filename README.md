# E-LEARNING-P

As part of my front-end web development internship at CodTech IT Solution, I was given the opportunity to design and develop a fully functional E-Learning Platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project marked a significant milestone in my learning journey, allowing me to gain hands-on experience in building a real-world application that supports online education. I used Visual Studio Code throughout the development process, which greatly enhanced my productivity with features like live server, syntax highlighting, and helpful extensions. Through this project, I learned how to structure web pages with HTML, style them effectively using CSS for a clean and responsive design, and implement interactivity with JavaScript to handle user actions and dynamic content. Developing this platform helped me understand key concepts such as DOM manipulation, responsive layouts, and project organization. It also taught me how to debug efficiently and manage code using version control with Git and GitHub. This experience not only improved my technical skills but also gave me confidence in applying my knowledge to build practical and user-friendly applications. Overall, the project was a valuable learning experience that strengthened my foundation in front-end development and prepared me for more complex challenges ahead.
